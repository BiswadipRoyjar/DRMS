## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project leverages **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** to create a **multi-disaster risk assessment model**.  
It integrates **satellite imagery + climate datasets** to detect and analyze areas prone to:  

- 🌊 Flood  
- 🔥 Wildfire  
- 🌵 Drought  
- 🪨 Landslide  
- 🌡️ Heatwave  
- 🌪️ Cyclone  

The final output is a **Disaster Risk Index (DRI)** map, which highlights **high, medium, and low-risk zones**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used  

- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** → Processing satellite & climate data  
- **Python / JavaScript API** → For scripting disaster indices  
- **Datasets Used:**  
  - *Sentinel-1 SAR* → Flood detection  
  - *MODIS Burned Area* → Fire mapping  
  - *CHIRPS Rainfall* → Drought monitoring  
  - *Sentinel-2 NDVI* → Vegetation loss (landslides, drought)  
  - *ERA5 Climate Reanalysis* → Heatwaves & Cyclones

## 🔄 Workflow  

1. **Data Collection** → Extract satellite data from GEE (Sentinel, MODIS, CHIRPS, ERA5).  
2. **Preprocessing** → Normalize indices like NDVI, rainfall, temperature, wind speed.  
3. **Hazard Detection** → Build individual models for each disaster:  
   - Flood = Sentinel-1 backscatter  
   - Wildfire = MODIS Burned Area Index  
   - Drought = CHIRPS Rainfall Anomaly  
   - Landslide = NDVI Drop + Rainfall + Slope  
   - Heatwave = Temperature Anomaly  
   - Cyclone = Wind Speed + Pressure Drop  
4. **Risk Index** → Combine all hazards → generate **composite DRI**.  
5. **Visualization** → Display risk maps in GEE interactive map viewer.

## ✨ Unique Features  

- Combines **6 disasters into one unified model**.  
- Works on **real-time satellite data** (no manual input needed).  
- Scalable → Can be expanded to more regions/datasets.  
- Useful for **government agencies, NGOs, and disaster response teams**.  
- Can integrate into **mobile apps or dashboards** for early warning systems.

## 📊 Model Capabilities  

- Detects **flood-prone regions** using radar signals.  
- Tracks **wildfire spread** using burn indices.  
- Identifies **drought-hit areas** from rainfall anomalies.  
- Highlights **landslide risks** using vegetation loss + slope.  
- Maps **heatwave intensity zones**.  
- Monitors **cyclone strength & path**.

## 🖥️ How to Run  

1. Open Google Colab.  
2. Upload the notebook `DISARM-AI_Disaster_detection.ipynb`.  
3. Run cells to authenticate GEE & visualize outputs.  
4. Export results as maps or GeoTIFF for external use.

## 📌 Future Improvements  

- Add **real-time alert system** (email/SMS alerts).  
- Integrate **AI/ML models** for predictive disaster mapping.  
- Deploy as a **web dashboard / mobile app**.
